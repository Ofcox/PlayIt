# PlayIt
PlayIt is a simple project similar to Rocksmith, but with different instrument - ukulele. It's at a very early stage and everyone can contribute. We're looking for ideas and people, that could make this game better and better.

It's a total mess, but I will fix it ASAP.

Depends on libraries:
OGRE-SDK-1.9.0 - will change after implementation of all basic features

Included:
Advanced Ogre Framework (modified to work without singletons)
