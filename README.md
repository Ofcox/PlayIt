# PlayIt
PlayIt is a simple project similar to Rocksmith, but with different instrument - ukulele. It's at a very early stage and everyone can contribute. We're looking for ideas and people, that could make this game better and better.

It's a total mess, but I will fix it ASAP.

Depends on libraries:
OGRE-SDK-1.9.0 - will change after implementation of all basic features.
Building Ogre is time consuming, you can grab binaries from http://ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=69274 or http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=81770

Included:
Advanced Ogre Framework (modified to work without singletons)

For the latest changes chceck the "targets" branch
